# android-junit5

[![Travis Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mannodermaus/android-junit5.svg?branch=master)][travisci]

A Gradle plugin that allows for the execution of [JUnit 5][junit5gh] tests in Android environments.

## Why a separate plugin?

The JUnit Platform team provides a Gradle plugin for running JUnit 5 on the JVM. However,
this plugin is tailored to the needs of a "purely Java" application, and doesn't work in
the context of the multi-variant world that we live in on Android. Therefore, this plugin was born.

It configures a `junitPlatformTest` task for each registered build variant of a project.
Furthermore, it automatically attaches both the Jupiter & Vintage Engines
during the execution phase of your tests as well, so there's very little configuration
necessary to get your project up-and-running on the JUnit Platform.

Instructions on how to write JUnit 5 tests can be found [in their User Guide][junit5ug].
Furthermore, this repository provides a small showcase of the functionality provided by JUnit 5 [here][sampletests].

## Download

```groovy
buildscript {
  dependencies {
    classpath "de.mannodermaus.gradle.plugins:android-junit5:1.0.22"
  }
}
```

Snapshots of the development version are available through [Sonatype's `snapshots` repository][sonatyperepo].

## Basic Setup

```groovy
apply plugin: "com.android.application"
apply plugin: "de.mannodermaus.android-junit5"

dependencies {
  // (Required) Writing and executing Unit Tests on the JUnit Platform.
  testImplementation junit5.unitTests()

  // (Optional) If you need "Parameterized Tests".
  testImplementation junit5.parameterized()
    
  // (Optional) For running tests inside Android Studio 3.x
  // Please refer to the "Android Studio Workarounds" section for more insight on this.
  testCompileOnly junit5.unitTestsRuntime()

  // (Optional) Writing and executing Instrumented Tests with the JUnit Platform Runner.
  //
  // IMPORTANT:
  // By declaring this dependency, you are required to use a minSdkVersion
  // of at least 26, since the nature of JUnit 5 relies on APIs that aren't
  // available on Android devices before then.
  // Additionally, you are required to explicitly enable support for instrumented tests in the
  // "junitPlatform" configuration closure (see the section below for details).
  androidTestImplementation junit5.instrumentedTests()
}
```

## Configuration

The plugin applies a configuration closure to your module's `android.testOptions`.
Inside it, you can use [all properties available through the default JUnit 5 Gradle plugin](junit5config).
However, there are a few more parameters that allow for more customization of the JUnit Platform
in your Android project. These are detailed below, alongside their default values:

```groovy
android {
  testOptions {
    // Configuration closure added by the plugin;
    // all configurable parameters related to JUnit 5 can be found here
    junitPlatform {
      // The JUnit Jupiter dependency version to use
      jupiterVersion "5.0.2"

      // The JUnit Vintage Engine dependency version to use
      vintageVersion "4.12.2"

      // Whether or not JUnit 5 test tasks should be affected by
      // JVM Arguments, System Properties & Environment Variables
      // declared through "unitTests.all" closures
      applyDefaultTestOptions true

      // Options related to running instrumented tests with JUnit 5.
      // This is an incubating feature which utilizes the backwards-compatibility
      // of the JUnit Platform in order to extend the default Test Instrumentation Runner
      // with new power. Because of their experimental nature and minSdkVersion requirement,
      // they are turned off by default. If you enable them, you also have to specify
      // the library dependency in your androidTest scope. Please refer to the "Instrumented Tests"
      // section for more details.
      instrumentationTests {
        enabled false

        // The Android-Instrumentation-Test dependency version to use
        version "0.1.0"
      }

      // Configuration of companion tasks for JaCoCo Reports,
      // associated with each JUnit 5 task generated by the plugin.
      // Just like the companion tasks themselves, these properties
      // will only have an effect if your module declares the "jacoco" plugin as well.
      // For each of the available report types, you can toggle the availability
      // and destination folders that they write to.
      jacoco {
        xml {
          enabled true
          destination project.file()
        }
        html {
          enabled true
          destination project.file()
        }
        csv {
          enabled true
          destination project.file()
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Android Studio Workarounds

> **Note:**
>
> The following section deals with fixing Test Execution within **Android Studio 3**.
> Running your JUnit 5 tests directly from Android Studio 2.3.3 and earlier **will not work**:
> You will encounter an `AbstractMethodError` when trying to do so ([more information here][as2issue]).
>
> The cause of this error is similar in nature to the one described below, and related to outdated APIs.
> Unlike that issue though, we can't fix the `AbstractMethodError` inside IntelliJ's internal runtime
> in the same way. Therefore, please resort to using Gradle for unit testing in Android Studio 2.


All versions up to and including **Android Studio 3.1 Canary** are built
on a version of IntelliJ IDEA that depends on outdated JUnit 5 APIs.
Therefore, your tests will fail with an Exception similar to the following when you try to
launch your tests from inside the IDE (using an *Android JUnit* Run Configuration):

```
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: org.junit.platform.launcher.Launcher.execute(Lorg/junit/platform/launcher/LauncherDiscoveryRequest;)V
	at com.intellij.junit5.JUnit5IdeaTestRunner.startRunnerWithArgs(JUnit5IdeaTestRunner.java:42)
	...
```

To work around this, there is a separate dependency you can add to the *test* scope
of your project in Android Studio 3. It provides its own copy of the JUnit 5 Runtime
provided by a more recent build of IntelliJ, overriding the one embedded in Android Studio.

To use this, add the following line alongside the other `junit5()` dependencies:

```groovy
dependencies {
  testCompileOnly junit5.unitTestsRuntime()
}
```
